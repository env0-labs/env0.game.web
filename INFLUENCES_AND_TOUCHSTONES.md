# INFLUENCES AND TOUCHSTONES

This document is a private compendium of creative touchstones.
It exists to re-anchor design decisions when progress stalls or tone drifts.

These are not references to be copied.
They are reminders of specific structural moves that worked elsewhere.

- Fallout (Terminals) — bureaucratic residue and faux-corporate tone

Use this list to jump to the pressure you’re trying to reapply.

## Control

## A Dark Room

**Informs:**

## Stories Untold

**Informs:**

## Usage Notes

This compendium is intentionally incomplete.

When stuck:
1. Identify the problem (too much meaning, too much fairness, too much explanation).
2. Scan the Quick Reference.
3. Read one section only.
4. Return to system constraints.

If the solution starts to resemble copying a scene, mechanic, or reveal,
stop and reassess.

This document exists to prevent drift, not to generate content.

# Recognition and Compliance Signals

This document describes the system’s recognition and punishment mechanisms.

These mechanisms exist to mirror institutional acknowledgement systems.
They do not alter system outcomes.
They do not reflect moral judgement.
They do not provide meaningful feedback.

They exist to sustain participation.

---

## Design Principles

- Recognition and punishment are not a single system.
- Recognition is archival.
- Punishment is operational.
- Neither system explains itself.
- Neither system affects truth.

These mechanisms are orthogonal to maintenance.

---

## Recognition (Arbitrary, Persistent)

### Purpose

Recognition exists to signal visibility without meaning.

It acknowledges behaviour without valuing it.
It persists without explanation.
It does not guide future action.

### Properties

- Recognition is permanent once recorded.
- Recognition has no mechanical effect.
- Recognition cannot be queried, filtered, or optimised.
- Recognition does not stack into hierarchy.

Examples of recognition shapes:
- Temporary titles
- Persistent annotations
- Logged classifications

Example phrasing (shape only):
- “[Employee of the Minute]”
- “[Annotation Recorded]”
- “[Classification: Persistent]”

Recognition may appear to be a reward system.
It is not.

---

### Arbitrary Triggers

Recognition triggers are:
- Hidden
- Arbitrary
- Per-player
- Often randomised

Examples:
- A command typed N times (N differs per player)
- A sequence of actions accidentally aligned
- A temporal coincidence

Triggers must never be discoverable.
Triggers must never be hinted.

Recognition is something that happens *to* the player, not *for* them.

---

## Punishment (Arbitrary, Temporary)

### Purpose

Punishment exists to introduce friction without instruction.

It does not correct behaviour.
It does not block progress.
It does not explain failure.

It makes work slightly worse for a while.

---

### Properties

- Punishment is temporary.
- Punishment expires silently.
- Punishment leaves no visible record.
- Punishment does not affect recognition.

Punishment should feel bureaucratic, not disciplinary.

---

### Acceptable Punishment Forms

Examples of valid punishment effects:

- Additional confirmation steps
- Increased verbosity
- Redundant acknowledgements
- Slight processing delays
- Increased interruption frequency

Examples of invalid punishment effects:

- Lockouts
- Access revocation
- Escalation language
- Moral judgement
- Explicit cause-and-effect explanation

Punishment is framed as “enhanced compliance”.

---

### Example Punishment Notice (Shape)

“You have failed to follow protocol and will be subject to enhanced compliance checks.”

No explanation follows.
No resolution is announced.
The system simply becomes more tedious.

---

## Relationship Between Recognition and Punishment

Recognition and punishment must never interact.

- Punishment does not remove recognition.
- Recognition does not protect against punishment.
- The presence of one does not explain the other.

They should feel like outputs from unrelated departments.

---

## Intended Psychological Effect

Over time, the player should learn:

- Recognition is permanent but meaningless.
- Punishment is temporary but unavoidable.
- Optimisation is futile.
- Correctness is procedural, not provable.

The player should stop trying to be good.
They should try to be invisible.

---

## Hard Constraints

If removing recognition and punishment would change system outcomes,
they are implemented incorrectly.

If removing them would only change how long a player continues,
they are implemented correctly.
